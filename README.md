# State Space Search (UCS, GBFS, A) for RushHour

Welcome to our GitHub repo [this `comp472` repo](https://github.com/hubjongit/comp472mp2) for our project where we built the structures to support the RushHour and then applied a suite of State Space Search Artifical Intelligence algorithms to solve it (optimally where it permits xD)

## How to Run
- Open your favourite terminal interface
- Install pipenv (our version-controlled Python environment of choice) if you don't already have it using:
  - `pip install pipenv`
- Clone our repo to a directory of your choice and navigate to the `comp472mp2` folder
- Make sure you have a `Python@3.9` version installed on your computer, if not run:
  - `brew install python@3.9`
- Setup the Python environment with the necessary packages with the simple command of:
  - `pipenv install` and the rest will happen on its own
- Once installed, you can launch the Jupyter Notebook interface with the command:
  - `jupyter notebook`
  - and from there select and run the `main.ipynb` file
- Enjoy :)
