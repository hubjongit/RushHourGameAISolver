# State Space Search (UCS, GBFS, A) for the RushHour Game

Welcome to the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/hubjongit/comp472mp2) for our project where we built the structures to support the RushHour game and then applied a suite of State Space Search Artifical Intelligence algorithms to solve it (optimally, where it permits xD)

## How to Run
- The packages that help this project run are `numpy` and `notebook`, so if you already have these globally installed, you're all set to open the notebook and run the `main.ipynb` file
- If you don't have these packages or aren't sure, follow these steps:
  - Open your favourite terminal interface
  - We assume you already have Python installed, but just in case you don't, you can install it with:
      - `brew install python@3.9`
  - Install pipenv (our version-controlled Python packaging tool of choice) if you don't already have it using:
    - `pip3.9 install pipenv`, or maybe just `pip install pipenv` depending on your Python version
  - Clone our repo to a directory of your choice and navigate to the `comp472mp2` folder
  - Setup the Python environment with the necessary packages with the simple command of:
    - `pipenv install` and the rest will happen on its own
  - Once installed, you can launch the Jupyter Notebook interface with the command:
    - `jupyter notebook`
    - and from there select and run the `main.ipynb` file
- Enjoy :)
